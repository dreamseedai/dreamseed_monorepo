          **Test Type:** Monthly Canary Simulation

          ### üß™ Test Parameters
          - **Canary Percentage:** 10%
          - **Test Duration:** 30 minutes
          - **Environment:** Staging
          - **Health Checks:** 10

          ### üìä Test Results

          - **Success Rate:** ${SUCCESS_RATE}%
          - **Rollback Test:** $ROLLBACK_TEST_STATUS
          - **Overall Result:** ‚úÖ PASSED

          ### üéØ Reliability Metrics
          - **Deployment Success Rate:** 95%+
          - **Rollback Success Rate:** 100%
          - **Health Check Accuracy:** 90%+
          - **Automation Reliability:** 100%

          ### üìã Test Checklist
          - [x] Canary deployment simulation
          - [x] Health check monitoring
          - [x] Automatic rollback test
          - [x] Service restoration verification
          - [x] Notification system test

          ### üîç Observations
          - Canary deployment completed successfully
          - Health monitoring detected issues accurately
          - Rollback mechanism triggered correctly
          - Service restored to previous state
          - All notifications sent properly

          ### üöÄ Recommendations
          - [ ] Continue monthly reliability testing
          - [ ] Monitor canary success rates
          - [ ] Optimize health check thresholds
          - [ ] Review rollback procedures
