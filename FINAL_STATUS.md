## 🔧 **Minor Issue: Nginx Proxy**

**Status**: The personalized API is working perfectly when accessed directly, but there's a minor Nginx proxy configuration issue preventing access through the web interface.

**Current Behavior**:
- ✅ Direct API access: `http://127.0.0.1:8013/api/personalized/*` - **WORKING**
- ⚠️ Web interface: `https://dreamseedai.com/api/personalized/*` - **502 Bad Gateway**

**Root Cause**: Nginx proxy configuration needs adjustment for the new port (8013).
