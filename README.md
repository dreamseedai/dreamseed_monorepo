- `portal-api/` - Backend API service (FastAPI)

### Packages (`packages/`)
- `shared-types/` - Shared TypeScript types
- `shared-utils/` - Shared utility functions
- `shared-ui/` - Shared UI components (coming soon)

### Infrastructure
- `scripts/` - Utility scripts and automation tools
- `.github/` - GitHub Actions workflows and templates
- `docs/` - Documentation and guides

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone git@github.com:mpcstudy/dreamseed_monorepo.git
cd dreamseed_monorepo

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Set up pre-commit hooks (recommended)
./scripts/setup-pre-commit.sh

# Start development
pnpm dev

# Build all packages
pnpm build

# Run tests
pnpm test
```

### Development Workflow

```bash
# Add a changeset for versioning
pnpm changeset

# Version packages (after PR merge)
pnpm version-packages

# Publish packages
pnpm release
```

## 🔧 Development Tools

### Repository Integrity Check

We maintain automated checks to ensure repository references are up-to-date:

```bash
# Check for legacy repository path references
./scripts/check-repo-strings.sh
```

This script is automatically run in:
- **Pre-commit hooks** (local development)
- **CI/CD pipelines** (GitHub Actions)
- **Branch protection rules** (PR validation)

### Pre-commit Hooks

Set up automatic checks before each commit:

```bash
# One-time setup
./scripts/setup-pre-commit.sh

# Manual run
pre-commit run --all-files
```

Pre-commit hooks will automatically:
- Check for legacy repository paths
- Verify Git remote URL
- Run standard code quality checks

### Pull Request Template

All pull requests automatically include a checklist for repository maintenance tasks, including:
- Remote URL verification
- README/Badge updates
- Branch protection review
- Secrets/Environment variables review

## 📋 Repository Maintenance

After repository renames or major changes, use the following checklist:

1. **Remote URL Update**: Verify with `git remote -v`
2. **Legacy Path Check**: Run `./scripts/check-repo-strings.sh`
3. **Documentation Update**: Update README, badges, and external links
4. **CI/CD Review**: Check workflows and secrets
5. **Branch Protection**: Review and update protection rules

### Branch Protection Setup

For complete protection, set up branch protection rules:
- See [docs/BRANCH_PROTECTION_SETUP.md](docs/BRANCH_PROTECTION_SETUP.md) for detailed instructions
- Enable "Repository Integrity Check" as a required status check
- Require PR reviews and up-to-date branches
