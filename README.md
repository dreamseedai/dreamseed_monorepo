# Set up pre-commit hooks (recommended)
./scripts/setup-pre-commit.sh

# Start development
pnpm dev

# Build all packages
pnpm build

# Run tests

```

## üîß Development Tools

### Repository Integrity Check

We maintain automated checks to ensure repository references are up-to-date:

```bash
# Check for legacy repository path references
./scripts/check-repo-strings.sh
```

This script is automatically run in:
- **Pre-commit hooks** (local development)
- **CI/CD pipelines** (GitHub Actions)
- **Branch protection rules** (PR validation)

### Pre-commit Hooks

Set up automatic checks before each commit:

```bash
# One-time setup
./scripts/setup-pre-commit.sh

# Manual run
pre-commit run --all-files
```

Pre-commit hooks will automatically:
- Check for legacy repository paths
- Verify Git remote URL
- Run standard code quality checks

### Pull Request Template

All pull requests automatically include a checklist for repository maintenance tasks, including:
- Remote URL verification
- README/Badge updates
- Branch protection review
- Secrets/Environment variables review

## üìã Repository Maintenance

After repository renames or major changes, use the following checklist:

1. **Remote URL Update**: Verify with `git remote -v`
2. **Legacy Path Check**: Run `./scripts/check-repo-strings.sh`
3. **Documentation Update**: Update README, badges, and external links
4. **CI/CD Review**: Check workflows and secrets
5. **Branch Protection**: Review and update protection rules

### Branch Protection Setup

For complete protection, set up branch protection rules:
- See [docs/BRANCH_PROTECTION_SETUP.md](docs/BRANCH_PROTECTION_SETUP.md) for detailed instructions
- Enable "Repository Integrity Check" as a required status check
- Require PR reviews and up-to-date branches

### Operations & Maintenance

- **[Operations Health Check](docs/OPERATIONS_HEALTHCHECK.md)** - 5-minute routine to ensure all automation works
- **[New Developer Onboarding](docs/ONBOARDING_GUIDE.md)** - Complete setup guide for new team members
- **[Branch Protection Setup](docs/BRANCH_PROTECTION_SETUP.md)** - Configure branch protection rules
- **[Micro Optimization Guide](docs/MICRO_OPTIMIZATION_GUIDE.md)** - Data-driven monthly optimization routine
- **[Monthly Operations Bookmark](docs/MONTHLY_OPERATIONS_BOOKMARK.md)** - Two-line monthly routine for complete automation
